  [33X[0;0YThis   version   of   [5XRCWA[105X   needs   at  least  [5XGAP[105XÂ 4.9.0  in  64-bit  mode,
  [5XResClasses[105XÂ 4.7.0,         [5XGRAPE[105XÂ 4.7Â [Soi16],        [5XPolycyclic[105XÂ 2.11Â [EHN13],
  [5XFR[105XÂ 2.2.1Â [Bar15], [5XGAPDoc[105XÂ 1.5.1Â [LN12], and [5XUtils[105XÂ 0.40Â [GKW16]. With possible
  exception  of the most recent version of [5XResClasses[105X, all needed packages are
  already present in an up-to-date standard [5XGAP[105X installation. The [5XRCWA[105X package
  is  completely  written in the [5XGAP[105X language and can be used on all platforms
  for which [5XGAP[105X is available.[133X
  
  
  [1X9.2 [33X[0;0YInstallation[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLike   any  other  [5XGAP[105X  package,  [5XRCWA[105X  is  usually  installed  in  the  [11Xpkg[111X
  subdirectory of the [5XGAP[105X distribution. This is accomplished by extracting the
  distribution file in this directory. If you have done this, you can load the
  package as usual via [10XLoadPackage( "rcwa" );[110X.[133X

  [33X[0;0YPerforms  a  nontrivial computation to check whether an installation of [5XRCWA[105X
  appears to work. Errors, i.e. differences to the correct results of the test
  computation,     are     reported.    The    processed    test    file    is

  [33X[1;0Y[29X[2XRCWATestAll[102X(  ) [32X function[133X
  [6XReturns:[106X  [33X[0;10Y[10Xtrue[110X if no errors were found, and [10Xfalse[110X otherwise.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRuns  the  full  test  suite  of  the  [5XRCWA[105X  package. Any differences to the
  supposed  results  of the test computations are reported. The processed test
  files are in the [11Xtst[111X subdirectory of the package directory.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPlease  note  that  the  test  suite is a tool for developing. The tests are
  deliberately  very  volatile  to allow to spot possible problems of any kind
  also  in  other  packages or in the [5XGAP[105X Library. For this reason you may see
  reports  of  differences  which  simply  reflect  improved  methods in other
  packages  or in the [5XGAP[105X Library (for example an object may already know more
  of  its attributes or properties than it is expected to, or an object may be
  represented  in  a  better  way),  or which are caused by changes of the way
  certain  objects  are  printed, and which are therefore harmless. However if
  the  correct  and  the actual output look different mathematically or if you
  see  error  messages  or  if  [5XGAP[105X  crashes, then something went wrong. Also,
  reports  about  significantly  increased run times of individual commands as
  well  as  run  times  of test files which are much longer than the predicted
  times shown may indicate a problem.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis  is  the  Info class of the [5XRCWA[105X package. See section [13XInfo Functions[113X in
  the  [5XGAP[105X  Reference  Manual  for  a  description  of the Info mechanism. For
  convenience: [10XRCWAInfo([110X[3Xn[103X[10X)[110X is a shorthand for [10XSetInfoLevel(InfoRCWA[110X,[3Xn[103X[10X)[110X.[133X
