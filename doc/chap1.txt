  [33X[0;0YThis  package  permits  to  compute  in monoids, in particular groups, whose
  elements  are  [13Xresidue-class-wise affine[113X mappings. Probably the widest-known
  occurrence  of  such  a  mapping is in the statement of the [22X3n+1[122X conjecture,
  which asserts that iterated application of the [13XCollatz mapping[113X[133X

  [33X[0;0Yto  any  given  positive  integer  eventually  yieldsÂ 1  (cf.Â [Lag03]).  For
  definitions, see SectionÂ [14X2.1[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPresently,  most  research  in  computational group theory focuses on finite
  permutation groups, matrix groups, finitely presented groups, polycyclically
  presented  groups and automata groups. For details, we refer toÂ [HEO05]. The
  purpose of this package is twofold:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOn  the  one  hand,  it  provides the means to deal with another large
        class  of groups which are accessible to computational methods, and it
        therefore extends the range of groups which can be dealt with by means
        of computation.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YOn  the  other  --  and perhaps more importantly -- residue-class-wise
        affine  groups  appear to be interesting mathematical objects in their
        own right, and this package is intended to serve as a tool to obtain a
        better  understanding  of  their  rich  and  often  complicated  group
        theoretical and combinatorial structure.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  principle  this  package permits to construct and investigate all groups
  which  have  faithful  representations  as residue-class-wise affine groups.
  Among  many  others, the following groups and their subgroups belong to this
  class:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFinite  groups,  and certain divisible torsion groups which they embed
        into.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFree groups of finite rank.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YFree products of finitely many finite groups.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YDirect products of the above groups.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YWreath products of the above groups with finite groups and withÂ (â„¤,+).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  list  permits  already  to  conclude that there are finitely generated
  residue-class-wise affine groups which do not have finite presentations, and
  such with algorithmically unsolvable membership problem. However the list is
  certainly  by  far  not  exhaustive,  and  using  this package it is easy to
  construct groups of types which are not mentioned there.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe group CT(â„¤) which is generated by all [13Xclass transpositions[113X ofÂ â„¤ -- these
  are   involutions  which  interchange  two  disjoint  residue  classes,  see
  [2XClassTransposition[102X  ([14X2.2-3[114X)  -- is a simple group which has subgroups of all
  types  listed  above.  It  is countable, but it has an uncountable series of
  simple subgroups which is parametrized by the sets of odd primes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YProofs  of  most  of  the  results mentioned so far can be found inÂ [Koh10].
  Descriptions  of  a part of the algorithms and methods which are implemented
  in this package can be found inÂ [Koh08].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe reader might want to know what type of results one can obtain with [5XRCWA[105X.
  However,  the  answer  to this is that the package can be applied in various
  ways  to various different problems, and it is simply not possible to say in
  general  what  can  be  found out with its help. So one really cannot give a
  better answer here than for the same question about [5XGAP[105X itself. The best way
  to  get  familiar  with  the  package  and  its  capabilities  is  likely to
  experiment  with  the  examples  discussed  in  this  manual  and the groups
  generated by 3 class transpositions from the corresponding data library.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf  course,  sometimes  this  package  does  not  provide  an out-of-the-box
  solution  for  a given problem. But quite often it is still possible to find
  an  answer by an interactive trial-and-error approach. With substantial help
  of  this  package,  the  author  has  found  the  results  mentioned  above.
  Interactive  sessions  with this package have also led to the development of
  most  of the algorithms which are now implemented in it. Just to mention one
  example,  developing  the factorization method for residue-class-wise affine
  permutations (seeÂ [2XFactorizationIntoCSCRCT[102X ([14X2.5-2[114X)) solely by means of theory
  would likely have been very hard.[133X
