                       Version history of the RCWA package
                       ===================================

Initial version: 1.0.0 (April 26, 2005)

Changes between version 1.0.0 and version 1.0.2:

 - Several cosmetic improvements have been made; no new functionality
   has been added.

Changes between version 1.0.2 and version 1.0.3:

 - `View' - methods for certain group rings of rcwa groups and their elements
   have been added (compact form to save space; not documented yet).

Changes between version 1.0.3 and version 1.1.0 (June 16, 2005)

 - The `Display' - method for rcwa mappings over the integers now recognizes
   an option `xdvi'. If this option is set, a LaTeX representation of the
   rcwa mapping is written to a file, LaTeX'ed and shown with xdvi.
   Try e.g. Display(Random(RCWA(Integers)):xdvi);.

 - An example `A group which acts 2-transitively on the positive integers'
   has been added to the manual. In this example, the 2-transitivity of
   a given wild rcwa group is checked computationally.

Changes between version 1.1.0 and version 1.2.0 (August 8, 2005)

 - An example `A group which acts 3-transitively, but not 4-transitively on Z'
   has been added to the manual. In this example, the 3-transitivity and
   non-4-transitivity of the action of a given wild rcwa group on Z is
   checked computationally.

 - The example which has been added in the previous version has been extended
   -- now it is checked that the given group acts even 4-transitively on the
   positive integers.

 - A `RepresentativeAction' method for RCWA(Z) and two unions of residue
   classes has been added.

Changes between version 1.2.0 and version 1.2.1

 - An adaptation to an incompatible change in GAP 4.4.6 w.r.t. `InstallValue'
   for families has been made.

Changes between version 1.2.1 and version 1.2.2

 - Some code which was misplaced in RCWA has been moved to the GAP library
   (rudimentary support for floats, `PadicValuation',
   `EpimorphismFromFreeGroup').

 - An example has been added to the manual in which finite quotients of
   Grigorchuk groups are constructed.

Changes between version 1.2.2 and version 1.3.0 (November 22, 2005)

 - Operations `Induction', `RightInverse' and `CommonRightInverse'
   have been added.

 - The code for `Restriction' has been improved.

 - RepresentativeAction(RCWA(Integers),P1,P2) works now also in cases
   where P1 and P2 do not consist entirely of single residue classes,
   but of unions of residue classes.

 - The multiplication of rcwa mappings is now slightly faster due to making
   use of a better bound for the modulus of the product.

 - The archive file now includes a copy of the author's thesis
   `Restklassenweise affine Gruppen' as well as an english translation of it.

Changes between version 1.3.0 and version 1.3.1

 - A list of a few (harmless!) errata for the author's thesis has been added.

Changes between version 1.3.1 and version 1.3.4

 - The errata known on 29/12/2005 have been corrected in the copy of the
   thesis distributed with this package.

 - A bunch of typo's in the english translation of the thesis has been
   corrected.

Changes between version 1.3.4 and version 1.3.5

 - The package documentation has been made autoloaded.

Changes between version 1.3.5 and version 1.3.6

 - A bug in `FactorizationIntoGenerators' which caused an infinite loop under
   certain circumstances has been fixed.

 - The shortening of the respected partition in the last factoring step in
   `FactorizationIntoGenerators' has been made much faster.

 - A special method for `RepresentativeActionOp' has been added.

 - A new test file tst/Ngens.tst has been added (corresponds to a preprint
   on minimal normal subgroups of RCWA(Z)).

Changes between version 1.3.6 and version 1.4.0 (January 27, 2006)

 - Significant parts of the documentation have been rewritten.

 - A synonym `Support' for `MovedPoints', a generic method
   for `NrMovedPoints' and an operation `Ball' have been added.

Changes between version 1.4.0 and version ...

 - The attribute `FactorizationIntoGenerators' has been renamed to
   `FactorizationIntoCSCRCT', and the method for computing such
   factorizations has been installed as a method for `Factorization'.
   The old name remains available as a synonym.

 - The mappings used in a preprint `Symmetrizing the 3n+1 Tree' and a few
   related examples have been added to examples/examples.g.

 - An example `Forward orbits of a monoid with two generators' has been
   added to the manual. In this example, it is checked by means of
   computation that the forward orbit of any positive integer under the
   action of the monoid generated by the two mappings
   T5+/-: n -> (n/2 if n even, (5n+/-1)/2 if n odd) contains 1.
