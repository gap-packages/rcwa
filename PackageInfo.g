I am grateful to John P. McDermott for the discovery that the group
discussed in Section&nbsp;<Ref Label="sec:ThompsonsGroupV"/> is
isomorphic to Thompson's Group V in July 2008, and to Laurent Bartholdi
for his hint on how to construct wreath products of residue-class-wise
affine groups with&nbsp;(&ZZ;,+) in April 2006.
Further, I thank Bettina&nbsp;Eick for communicating this package
and for her valuable suggestions on its manual in the time before its
first public release in April 2005.
Last but not least I thank the two anonymous referees for their
constructive criticism and their helpful suggestions.
